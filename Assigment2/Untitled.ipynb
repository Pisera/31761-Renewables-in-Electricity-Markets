    "Please consider a wind farm with the nominal (installed) capacity of 150 MW. We are interested to formulate and solve an offering strategy problem for this farm. This problem determines her participation strategy in the day‐ahead market (in terms of her hourly production quantities). that her offer price is zero. We consider a time framework of 24 hours. Please also note that we discard reserve and intra‐day markets, and consider day‐ahead and balancing markets only."

Discarding the potential correlation between these two sources of uncertainty, the total number of scenarios is equal to the number of scenarios for uncertain source 1 times the number of scenarios for uncertain source 2. For example, if we consider 10 wind power forecast scenarios and 5 day‐ahead price forecast scenarios, this results in 5*10 = 50 scenarios.  \n",

    "**Reference 2:** You can get wind data from FINGERID website(https://www.fingrid.fi/en/electricitymarket/electricity‐market‐information/wind‐power‐generation/) or ELIA website (https://www.elia.be/en/griddata/power‐generation/wind‐power‐generation), and normalize them for a 150‐MW wind farm. Although they report “aggregate” wind data, you can assume they are data for an individual farm. The wind profile during a day can be seen as a scenario. For example, wind profile on March 1 can be seen as scenario 1. This profile on March 2 can be seen as the second scenario, and so on."

    "2. While keeping the coefficient for the balancing market price under power excess condition to 0.9, vary the other coefficient from 1.05 to 1.35, and explore how the offerings strategy of the wind farm changes. Similarly, keep coefficient 1.2 unchanged, and vary the other one from 0.75 to 0.95. These results can be illustrated through a couple of figures. A discussion on results is recommended.\n",
    "3. For fixed coefficients of 0.9 and 1.2 and given value of $\\\\alpha = 0.90$, formulate and solve the riskaverse offering strategy problem. Recall that the objective function is in the form of $[(expected \\\\ profit)\\ + (\\\\beta * CVaR)]$.  \n",
    "Gradually increase the value of $\\\\beta$, starting from zero. For each value of $\\\\beta$, save the values obtained for the expected profit and for the CVaR, and plot a 2‐dimention figure ($expected profit$ versus $CVaR$). Note that the $CVaR$ value does not include $\\\\beta$. Please interpret this figure. In addition, please explain how the offering strategy of the wind farm and her profit volatility over scenarios are changing by increasing $\\\\beta$. Finally, for different values of confidence level (i.e., \\\\alpha=0.80 and \\\\alpha=0.95), repeat this step and report your observations."
